# mongodeform

This is an implementation of
[Deform](http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/deform/en/latest/) for
[MongoEngine](http://mongoengine.org/) documents.

It is based on [django-mongodbforms](https://github.com/jschrewe/django-mongodbforms),
replacing Django dependencies with Deform equivalents, so it can (theoretically)
be used with any web framework that uses MongoEngine, though
[Pyramid](http://www.pylonsproject.org/) is the main focus.

## Requirements

  * Deform >= 0.9.7
  * MongoEngine >= 0.6

## Usage

mongodeform's usage will be similar to django-mongodbforms in most cases, except
in Django-specific areas.
